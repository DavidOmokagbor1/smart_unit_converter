### **Step 1: Start the Server**
```bash

4. **Tap "Add"**

### **Step 4: Test the Installed App**
1. **Find the app icon** on your home screen
2. **Tap to open** - it should launch like a native app
3. **Test offline** - turn off WiFi and try using it
4. **Test conversions** - try different unit conversions

## 🛠️ **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **If "Add to Home Screen" Doesn't Appear:**
1. **Check HTTPS** - PWA requires secure connection

3. **Clear Safari cache** - Settings > Safari > Clear History
4. **Restart Safari** - Close and reopen the app

### **If App Doesn't Install:**
1. **Check manifest** - Visit `/docs/manifest.json`
2. **Check service worker** - Look for errors in console
3. **Try different URL** - Use the full path to index.html
4. **Check iOS version** - PWA requires iOS 11.3+

### **If Offline Doesn't Work:**
1. **Wait for service worker** - It needs time to cache
2. **Check network** - Make sure you're actually offline
3. **Refresh the page** - Sometimes needed for first load
4. **Check console** - Look for service worker errors
