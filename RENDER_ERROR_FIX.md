# 🔧 Render Error Fixed!

## ❌ **Error Fixed**

**Problem**: `constructor is not callable` error in HomeScreen.js line 47

**Cause**: Trying to instantiate ConversionService with `new ConversionService()` when it's exported as a singleton

**Location**: `HomeScreen.js` line 47

---

## ✅ **What I Fixed**

### **Before (Broken):**
```javascript
// Initialize conversion service
const conversionService = useMemo(() => new ConversionService(), []);
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```javascript
// Initialize conversion service
const conversionService = useMemo(() => ConversionService, []);
```

### **Explanation:**
The ConversionService is exported as a singleton instance (`export default new ConversionService();`), not as a class. So we don't need to use `new` to instantiate it - we just use the imported instance directly.
